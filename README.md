### Classifying Dog Vocalizations

The following project analyzes dog vocalizations to determine if the emotions expressed by dogs are similar in their acoustic structure. A distinct difference in dog vocalizations can improve communication between a dog and their owner and the overall well-being of the animal. 
  
Data was collected manually through YouTube to select videos that portrayed specific emotions commonly expressed by dogs. The audio was then extracted, edited, and converted into WAV files for analysis. 
  
Dynamic time warping was performed manually to improve efficiency and save memory. A dissimilarity matrix was then created to compare the acoustic structures of the time series and cluster them for a visual representation of similarity. It was found that, generally, the same emotions were clustered together.
  
Analyzing the acoustic structure of dog vocalizations is important in domestic settings and veterinary practices to improve the well-being of dogs through understanding what they are trying to communicate. Further research would involve determining frequencies at which dog vocalizations are no longer audible to the human ear, which would hinder this distinction and affect communication between dogs and humans. Additionally, analyzing the acoustic structure of vocalizations in other animals would be beneficial for biodiversity and animal welfare across the globe.
